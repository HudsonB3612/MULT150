/*
 * I believe the game is well balanced
 *
 * More chaos balls would make the game more difficult, as well
 *    as requiring the player to hit it in instead of it bouncing
 *    in randomly
 *
 * Sound effects and better visuals would give it that "wow" factor.
 *
 * Running after the balls are very tedious but hitting the ball into
 *    a goal is very rewarding.

/*
 * Added a timer to track completion time.
 * Created two types of chaos balls with different speeds.
 * Changed the player bumper shape to be wider.
 * Added a Play Again button upon game completion.
